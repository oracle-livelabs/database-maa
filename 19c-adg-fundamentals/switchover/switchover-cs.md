# How to Perform Database Switchover

## Introduction
In this lab, we will be performing a switchover operation.

Oracle Data Guard helps you change the role of databases between primary and standby using either a switchover or failover operation.

A switchover is a role reversal between the primary database and one of its standby databases. A switchover guarantees no data loss and is typically done for planned maintenance of the primary system. During a switchover, the primary database transitions to a standby role, and the standby database transitions to the primary role.
When working with the OCI console, a switchover is always started from the primary database.

A failover is a role transition in which one of the standby databases is transitioned to the primary role after the primary database (all instances in the case of an Oracle RAC database) fails or has become unreachable.
A failover may or may not result in data loss depending on the protection mode in effect at the time of the failover.
When working with the OCI console, a failover is started from the standby database that will become primary.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 Minutes

### Objectives
- Verify the database roles in the database
- Perform a switchover

### Prerequisites
- Connect to the Database


## Task 1: Verify the database roles in the database

1. From the **first browser tab** with Cloud Shell, connect to the primary host (skip this step if you are still connected from the previous lab):
    ````
    <copy>ssh -i cloudshellkey opc@IP_ADDRESS</copy>
    ````
    Replace `cloudshellkey` with the name of your private key file, and `IP_ADDRESS` with the real public IP address.

2. You should be connected to the primary database host. You can become **oracle** with `sudo su - oracle` and connect to the instance with the command `sqlplus / as sysdba` and execute a query:

    ````
    <copy>Select name, db_unique_name, database_role from v$database;</copy>
    ````

1. From the **second browser tab** with Cloud Shell, connect to the standby host (skip this step if you are still connected from the previous lab):
    ````
    <copy>ssh -i cloudshellkey opc@IP_ADDRESS</copy>
    ````
    Replace `cloudshellkey` with the name of your private key file, and `IP_ADDRESS` with the real public IP address.

2. You should be connected to the primary database host. You can become **oracle** with `sudo su - oracle` and connect to the instance with the command `sqlplus / as sysdba` and execute a query:

    ````
    <copy>Select name, db_unique_name, database_role from v$database;</copy>
    ````

We can conclude from the previous outputs which database is PRIMARY and which is a PHYSICAL STANDBY.

## Task 2: Perform the role transition

1. In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, navigate to the DB System Details of the ADGHOLAD1 database and scroll down to the Databases section.

    Overview
    -> Oracle Base Database (VM, BM)
    -> DB Systems

2. Select **ADGHOLAD1**

3. In the Databases section click on the name **DGHOL** and in the next screen scroll down and click on **Data Guard Associations (1)** in the left pane.

4. Click the 3 dots on the right, and click **Switchover**

5. This activity will require some downtime, so the tooling asks for the password. Enter the SYS password (WElcome123##) from the Primary database and click **OK**. The role transition starts.

6. At this point, the lifecycle state will be updating and the role transition happens in the background.

7. After some time the role transition finished and the state is Available again.

    > **Note:** If you get an error indicating that the failover failed and you need to open an SR, try again and enter the sys password correctly.

## Task 3: Verify the database roles in the database

1. From the **first browser tab** with Cloud Shell, reconnect as sysdba, and reissue the verification of the role:

    ````
    <copy>connect / as sysdba</copy>
    <copy>Select name, db_unique_name, database_role from v$database;</copy>
    ````
  ![](./images/new-standby.png)

1. Do the same in the **second browser tab** :
    ````
    <copy>connect / as sysdba</copy>
    <copy>Select name, db_unique_name, database_role from v$database;</copy>
    ````
  ![](./images/new-primary.png)

  We can conclude that the Database that was PRIMARY is now PHYSICAL STANDBY, and vice versa.

You have now successfully performed a graceful role transition.
