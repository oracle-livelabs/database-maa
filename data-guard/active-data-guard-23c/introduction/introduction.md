# Oracle Database 23ai Active Data Guard

## Introduction

Oracle Data Guard provides a comprehensive set of services that create, maintain, manage, and monitor one or more standby databases to enable production Oracle databases to survive disasters and data corruptions.

Oracle Data Guard maintains these standby databases as copies of the production database. Then, if the production database becomes unavailable because of a planned or an unplanned outage, Oracle Data Guard can switch any standby database to the production role, minimizing the downtime associated with the outage. Oracle Data Guard can be used with traditional backup, restoration, and cluster techniques to provide a high level of data protection and data availability.

Oracle (Active) Data Guard capabilities in Oracle Database 23ai further enhance its strategic objective of preventing data loss, providing high availability, eliminating risk, and increasing return on investment by enabling highly functional active disaster recovery systems that are simple to deploy and manage.

It accomplishes this by providing the management, monitoring, and automation software infrastructure to create and maintain one or more synchronized standby databases that protect Oracle data from failures, data corruption, human error, and disasters

This workshop focuses on **Creating Active Data Guard 23ai in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using Base Database Services (BaseDB)**.

Instead of leveraging the Control Plane automation to create the Data Guard association, this workshop will guide you through the manual creation of the standby database and the Data Guard configuration, to provide a similar experience to on-premises and hybrid environments. Similarly, complex topologies that cannot be achieved with the Control Plane automation, require manual Data Guard setup in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
