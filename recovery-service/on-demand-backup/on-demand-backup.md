# Create an on-demand backup

## Introduction

This lab shows you how start an on-demand backup which will backup the database immediately.  The following two options are available for on-demand backups:  
1. An incremental backup that follows the retention policy for the database.  This is helpful if you are performing mantenance on the database and want a backup but don't want to adjust the regular schedule.
2. A long-term retention backup that follows a retention period you define.  This is helpful if you need a backup for compliance, like an end-of-month backup.  This full backup is created from your existing backups in Recovery Service, so there is no load on the database while creating long-term backups.

Once either of these backup types start, you can monitor the status and see the results in the backup history.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes
