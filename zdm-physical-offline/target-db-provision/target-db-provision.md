# Provision target database

## Introduction

You must create a placeholder target database before beginning a migration to the target environment. 

The placeholder target database is overwritten during migration, but it retains the overall configuration.

Please note as of Zero Downtime Migration Release 21.4 , only Grid Infrastructure-based database services are supported as targets. For example, an LVM-based instance or an instance created in compute node without Grid Infrastructure are not supported targets.

You must use the control plane for the creation of a target placeholder database on Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure and Exadata Cloud at Customer.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab

* You will collect information from the source database required for target database provisioning.

* You will prepare a database software image for the target database.

* You will provision an Oracle Base Database VM to use as the target database system.

### Prerequisites

* All previous labs have been successfully completed.

## Task 1 : Collect Source Database Details

1. Check the Operating System version of the source database.

   Login to the source database compute using the Public IP and privte SSH key.

   Username to login : **opc** 

   Execute the below command after logged in as **opc** user.
     
     ```text
     <copy>
     cat /etc/os-release
     </copy>
     ```
     Please use similar commands in case above command doesn't work for you ( in case you have selected different source database system than the one specified in Lab 2).

     You will get an output similar to the one below.

2. Establish connection to source database.

   Switch user to **oracle** using below command after logged into source database compute.

   **sudo su - oracle**

   Set the environment to connect to your database.

   Type **. oraenv** and press **Enter**. 
    
   Enter **ORCL** when asked for **ORACLE\_SID** and then press **Enter** (Enter your ORACLE\_SID in case if it is different).

   Type **sqlplus "/as sysdba"**  and press **Enter** to connect to source database as SYS user.

   Please find below snippet of the connection steps.

3. Check the database edition of the source database.

   Source database you had provisioned in previous lab is an **Enterprise Edition** database since the Oracle Marketplace Image used provisions an Enterprise Edition database.

   In case you would like know the database edition for your on-premises database then refer the below steps.

   Execute the below query after connecting to source database using sqlplus.
     ```console
     <copy>
     select banner from v$version;
     </copy>
      ```
     You will receive an output similar to the one below which will have the Database Edition.

4. Check database characterset.
   
   Execute the below query after connecting to source database using connection established in step 2.
     ```console
     <copy>
     select PARAMETER,VALUE from nls_database_parameters where parameter like '%NLS%CHARACTERSET';
     </copy>
      ```
     In the query output **NLS\_CHARACTERSET** is the database characterset and **NLS\_NCHAR\_CHARACTERSET** is the national characterset.

     Sample output is shown below.

     ![Image showing database and national character set in database](./images/database-characterset.png)

5. Check encryption algorithm under sqlnet.ora.

   Check the **$ORACLE\_HOME\network\admin\sqlnet.ora** file in source database compute to identify any encryption algorithm mentioned.

6. Generate patch inventory output.

   Execute below steps after logged into the source database compute.

   Switch user to **oracle** using below command.

   **sudo su - oracle**

   Set the PATH variable using below command.

   export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch:$PATH

   Execute below command.

   **opatch lsinventory**

   Below is sample trimmed output of the above command.

   Provide **zdm-target-db** as Hostname prefix.

   ![Image showing the Network select for DB system](./images/network-hostname.png)

10. Click Next

    Leave the **Diagnostics collection** section to default and Click **Next** to go to the next page as shown below.

    ![Image showing the diagnostic collection setting and option to go to next screen](./images/diag-collection.png)

11. Provide database name.

   If the target database is in Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure or Exadata Cloud at Customer, then the target database **DB\_NAME** should be the same as the source database **DB\_NAME**.

   If the target database is Oracle Base Database Service , then the target **DB\_NAME** can be the same as or different from the source database **DB\_NAME**.

   Our target database is **Oracle Base Database Service** and we can specify a same or different name for **DB\_NAME**. 

   We will keep the same **DB\_NAME** as source database for this lab.

   Provide **Database** name as **ORCL** and **Database unique name suffix** as **T**.

   ![Image showing the Database Name entered](./images/dbname.png)

   Select **Custom Database Software Images** as shown below.

   ![Image showing selection of Database Software Image](./images/custom.png)

   Select the appropriate compartment and select DB Image created in earlier lab as below.

   ![Image showing custom software images created earlier](./images/db-image.png)

   Click on **Select** to finalise the selection as shown below.

   ![Image showing custom software images created earlier](./images/db-image-selection-final.png)


13. Provide SYS password.

   Enter SYS password which is same as the SYS password of the source database.

   ![Image showing the provision to enter SYS password](./images/sys-password.png)

14. Select database workload type.

   In this lab , leave it to the default.

15. Disable database backups.

   Uncheck the **Enable automatic backups** box to disable database backups.

   We don't need automatic backups until we complete the database migration.

   ![Image showing the option to disable database backups](./images/disable-db-backup.png)

16. Select database charactetset.

   Click on **show advanced** options.

   Ensure that you have selected same database and national characterset as the source database.

   In this lab source database has below Database and National Characterset.

   Database Characterset : AL32UTF8

   National Characterset : AL16UTF16

   Sample output is shown below.

   ![Image showing the database characterset selected](./images/db-characterset.png)

17. Start DB System provisioning.

   Click on the **Create DB System** to initiate the DB system provisioning.

   ![Image showing the option to start the provisioning](./images/db-prov-final.png)

   This step is going to take up to 1 hour , however you can proceed to next lab while DB System is being provisioned.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
