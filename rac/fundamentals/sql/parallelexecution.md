### About Parallel Execution
Parallel execution enables the application of multiple CPU and I/O resources to the execution of a single SQL statement. Parallel execution is sometimes called parallelism. Parallelism is the idea of breaking down a task so that, instead of one process doing all of the work in a query, many processes do part of the work at the same time.

Parallel execution improves processing for:
* Queries requiring large table scans, joins, or partitioned index scans
* Creation of large indexes
* Creation of large tables, including materialized views
* Bulk insertions, updates, merges, and deletions

Parallel execution benefits systems with all of the following characteristics:
* Symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs), clusters, or massively parallel systems
* Sufficient I/O bandwidth
* Underutilized or intermittently used CPUs (for example, systems where CPU usage is typically less than 30%)
* Sufficient memory to support additional memory-intensive processes, such as sorting, hashing, and I/O buffers

If your system lacks any of these characteristics, parallel execution might not significantly improve performance. In fact, parallel execution may reduce system performance on overutilized systems or systems with small I/O bandwidth.

The benefits of parallel execution can be observed in DSS and data warehouse environments. OLTP systems can also benefit from parallel execution during batch processing and during schema maintenance operations such as creation of indexes. The average simple DML or SELECT statements that characterize OLTP applications would not experience any benefit from being executed in parallel.

## Task 1:  Grant DBA to the SH user
1.  If you aren't already logged in to the Oracle Cloud, open up a web browser and re-login to Oracle Cloud.

2.  Start Cloud Shell

    *Note:* You can also use Putty or MAC Cygwin if you chose those formats in the earlier lab.  
    ![open CloudShell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-livelabs/common/main/images/console/cloud-shell.png " ")

3.  Connect to node 1 as the *opc* user (you identified the IP address of node 1 in the Build DB System lab).

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/sshkeyname opc@<<Node 1 Public IP Address>>
    ````
    ![SSH to node-1](../clusterware/images/racnode1-login.png " ")

4.  Switch to the oracle user and connect to the pluggable database, **PDB1** as SYSDBA.  *Replace the welcome password with your database password.*

    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    srvctl config scan
    sqlplus sys/W3lc0m3#W3lc0m3#@//<PutScanNameHere>/pdb1.pub.racdblab.oraclevcn.com as sysdba
    </copy>
    ````

5. Grant DBA to SH and then exit out of sql*plus, the oracle user and switch to the grid user.

    ````
    <copy>
    grant dba to sh;
    exit
    exit
    sudo su - oracle
    </copy>
    ````
    ![Add DBA privileges](./images/dba-sh-grid.png " ")


## Task 2: Run a parallel query operation

1. Ensure that the **testy** service created earlier is running on instance 1.

    ````
    <copy>
    crsctl stat res -t
    </copy>
    ````
    ![Examine resource status](./images/testy-node1.png " ")

2.  According to the output, our service is still running on node 2.  Let's relocate it.  If your service is already running on node 1 you can skip this step.  Run this as the *grid* user on **node 1** replacing the dbname with your dbname.  (You can find it in the output from the command above).  Run crsctl stat again to see if it moved the service.

    ````
    <copy>
    srvctl relocate service -d atfdbvm_dbname -s testy -oldinst aTFdbVm2 -newinst aTFdbVm1   
    crsctl stat res -t

    </copy>
    ````
    ![Relocate Database Service](./images/relocate.png " ")
    ![Examine resource status](./images/testy-node2.png " ")

3. Connect to this service as the SH user. Connect on **node 1**.

    ````
    sudo su - oracle
    srvctl status service -d aTFdbVm_replacename -s testy
    sqlplus sh/W3lc0m3#W3lc0m3#@//racnode-scan.tfexsubdbsys.tfexvcndbsys.oraclevcn.com/testy.tfexsubdbsys.tfexvcndbsys.oraclevcn.com
    ````

    ![Examine resource status](./images/ll-num3.png " ")
    ![Open SQL*Plus session](./images/ll-num3-1.png " ")

4. Show your connection details

    ````
    <copy>
    select sid from v$mystat where rownum=1;
    col sid format 9999
    col username format a10
    col program format a40
    col service_name format a20
    set linesize 100
    select sid, username, program, service_name from v$session where username='SH';
    </copy>
    ````
    ![SELECT from V$SESSION](./images/ll-num4.png " ")

5. Enable tracing and use a HINT to force parallel execution of a SQL query.  Use the client ID of *racpx01*.

    ![Disable client tracing](./images/pq-1.png " " )

    ````
    <copy>
    exec dbms_session.set_identifier('racpx01');
    alter session set tracefile_identifier = 'racpx01';
    exec dbms_monitor.client_id_trace_enable(client_id=>'racpx01');

    select /*+parallel*/ p.prod_name, sum(s.amount_sold) from products p, sales s
    where p.prod_id = s.prod_id group by p.prod_name;

    exec dbms_monitor.client_id_trace_disable(client_id=>'racpx01');    
    </copy>
    ````
    ![Select data from table](./images/ll-num6.png " ")
6. Look for the trace files to see which node the PX (parallel execution processes) ran on

    ````
    <copy>
    col value format a60
    select inst_id, value from gv$parameter where name='diagnostic_dest';
    exit
    </copy>
    ````
    The diagnostic_dest will be displayed.

    ![Identify diagnostic dump destination](./images/ll-num7.png " ")

7.  From the operating system, search for trace files containing the client identifier set above, racpx01

    ````
    <copy>
    ls -altr /u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/atfdbvm_replacename/aTFdbVm1/trace/*racpx01*.trc
    </copy>
    ````
    ![List log file names](./images/ll-num7-1.png " ")

    QUESTION:  Were any parallel execution processes started on node2? Look in the /u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/atfdbvm_replacename/aTFdbVm2/trace directory

8.  Relocate the **testy** service to instance 2, but keep your client connection on racnode1, and repeat steps 1 - 3

    ````
    srvctl relocate service -d aTFdbVm_replacename -s testy -oldinst aTFdbVm1
    sqlplus sh/W3lc0m3#W3lc0m3#@//racnode-scan.tfexsubdbsys.tfexvcndbsys.oraclevcn.com/testy.tfexsubdbsys.tfexvcndbsys.oraclevcn.com
    ````

9.  Your connection details will now be similar to

    ````
    col sid format 9999
    col username format a10
    col program format a40
    col service_name format a20
    set linesize 100
    select sid, username, program, service_name from v$session where username='SH';
    ````
    ![Select from v$SESSION](./images/ll-num9.png " ")

10. Choose a new trace file identifier and run the SELECT statement again using *racpx05* as the identifier.  So now that you have relocated the service, let's see where the trace files are created, node 1 or node 2?

    ````
    <copy>
    exec dbms_session.set_identifier('racpx05');
    alter session set tracefile_identifier = 'racpx05';
    exec dbms_monitor.client_id_trace_enable(client_id=>'racpx05');

    select /*+parallel*/ p.prod_name, sum(s.amount_sold) from products p, sales s
    where p.prod_id = s.prod_id group by p.prod_name;

    exec dbms_monitor.client_id_trace_disable(client_id=>'racpx05');
    </copy>
    ````  
    ![Enable tracing and select data](./images/ll-num10-1.png " ")
11. Where are the trace files located now?  If you answered node 2, you are correct!  On node 1, only the racpx01 files exist.

    ![Locate log files](./images/ll-num7-1.png " ")

12. On racnode2, the racpx05 files exist.

    ![List log file names](./images/ll-num12.png " " )

In Oracle RAC systems, the service placement of a specific service controls parallel execution. Specifically, parallel processes run on the nodes on which the service is configured. By default, Oracle Database runs parallel processes only on an instance that offers the service used to connect to the database. This does not affect other parallel operations such as parallel recovery or the processing of GV$ queries.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
