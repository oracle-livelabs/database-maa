# Provision source database

## Introduction

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab

* You will provision a Virtual Cloud Network in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
* You will provision source database using Oracle Marketplace image available in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

* All previous labs have been successfully completed.

## Task 1 : Create Virtual Cloud Network

In this task you will create a new Virtual Cloud Network which will be used to host source database compute , target database system and ZDM service host.

1. Login to your Oracle Cloud Console.

2. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Networking** and then select **Virtual Cloud Networks**.

   Once details are entered , click on **Next**.

7. On the next screen , click on **Create**.

## Task 2 : Provision Source Database

1. Login to your Oracle Cloud Console.

2. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Marketplace** and then select **All Applications**.

5. Select an Oracle Database version which is latest ( There will be one on OL7 and one on OL8).
    
   Please choose database on Oracle Linux 7 since your Target DB system will be on Oracle Linux 7 for this lab.

   Please make a note of the exact database version with Release Update since it will be required in next Lab.

6. Ensure to select the correct compartment in your tenancy and then click on **Launch Instance**.

12. Take a note of the Public IP address of the compute instance which will used to login to source database system.

13. Collect the value of SYS password.

    Login to the source database server using the Public IP and private ssh key.

    Please refer the value of RACPASSWORD variable in file /u01/ocidb/params.ini for SYS,SYSTEM,PDBADMIN and SYSMAN password.

    
    
You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
