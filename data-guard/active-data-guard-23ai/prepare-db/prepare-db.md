# Prepare the databases for Data Guard

## Introduction
In this lab, we prepare the databases for the Data Guard configuration.

This lab uses a manual Data Guard configuration on top of two OCI Base Database Service systems. The first one, on host `adghol0`, is the primary database. We will wipe out the second one on host `adghol1` to restore it as a standby database.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 Minutes

### Requirements
To try this lab, you must have completed **Lab 1: Prepare the database hosts**

### Objectives
- Prepare the primary database for Data Guard
- Clean up the standby database system
- Duplicate the database for standby
- Finish the standby database configuration

## Task 1: Prepare the primary database for Data Guard

You should have two Cloud Shell tabs connected to the primary and secondary hosts, adghol0 and adghol1. Otherwise, follow the first steps of Lab 1 until you have both SSH connections established.
Make sure you are using the `oracle` user.

1. **On the primary host** `adghol0`, get the `DB_UNIQUE_NAME` of the primary database. It differs for every deployment, so we must replace it in the workshop commands. On OCI BaseDB, the environment variable `$ORACLE_UNQNAME` is set to the correct value:
    
    ```
    <copy>echo $ORACLE_UNQNAME</copy>
    ```

    Note its value, as you will require it often during this workshop.

    **From now on, we'll refer to its value as `ADGHOL0_UNIQUE_NAME`.**

2. Connect to the Data Guard broker client command line (dgmgrl). We use **SQLcl** for most steps, but some, including `PREPARE DATABASE`, still require `dgmgrl`.

    ```
    <copy>dgmgrl /</copy>
    ```

3. Execute the following command to prepare the primary database for its Data Guard role.

    **Make sure to change the value of `ADGHOL0_UNIQUE_NAME` accordingly.**

    ```
    <copy>
    prepare database for data guard
    with db_unique_name is ADGHOL0_UNIQUE_NAME
    db_recovery_file_dest_size is "200g"
    db_recovery_file_dest is "/u03/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area"
    restart;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Execution of the PREPARE DATABASE command](images/prepare-primary.png)

    This new 23ai command checks and sets many required and recommended parameters and settings, including:
    * SPFILE preparation
    * Recommended parameters
    * Archivelog mode
    * Force logging
    * Flashback logging
    * RMAN archivelog deletion policy
    * Standby redo logs (SRLs)
    * `DB_UNIQUE_NAME`

    Because some of these changes require a restart of the instance, we specified the `restart` keyword to confirm we agree to do that, if required.

    For more information, [refer to the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/dgbkr/oracle-data-guard-broker-commands.html#GUID-46F6267D-E3CF-4544-AC47-A22D9704BAF2).

4. Exit the `dgmgrl` command-line:
    
    ```
    <copy>exit</copy>
    ```


## Task 2: Clean up the standby database system

1. **On the secondary host** `adghol1`, get the `DB_UNIQUE_NAME` of the standby database. On OCI BaseDB, the environment variable `$ORACLE_UNQNAME` is set to the correct value:
  
    ```
    <copy>echo $ORACLE_UNQNAME</copy>
    ```
    Note its value, as you will require it often during this workshop.
  
    **From now on, we'll refer to its value as `ADGHOL1_UNIQUE_NAME`.**

2. Connect as SYSDBA and shut down the current database (make sure you are on host `adghol1`):

    ```
    <copy>sql / as sysdba</copy>
    ```
    Then:
    ```
    <copy>
    shutdown abort
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

3. Remove data files, redo logs, and control files. We will restore everything from the primary database:

    ```
    <copy>
    rm -rf /u02/app/oracle/oradata/${ORACLE_UNQNAME,,}/${ORACLE_UNQNAME^^}/*
    rm -rf /u03/app/oracle/redo/${ORACLE_UNQNAME^^}/*
    rm -f /u02/app/oracle/oradata/${ORACLE_UNQNAME,,}/control01.ctl /u03/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area/${ORACLE_UNQNAME,,}/control02.ctl
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Duplicate the database for standby

Oracle recommends using `RESTORE FROM SERVICE` to instantiate the standby database. That has the advantage of letting users retry the restore operation without restarting the copy of the data files that have already been restored. However we use the `DUPLICATE` command in this lab for simplicity.

1. **On the secondary host** `adghol1`, where we prepare the standby database, start the standby instance:

    ```
    <copy>sql / as sysdba</copy>
    ```
    Then:
    ```
    <copy>
    startup nomount force
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Start the standby in nomount](images/standby-nomount.png)

2. Connect to the primary and standby instances with the Recovery Manager (RMAN) command line, 

    For the standby instance, we must use the static service registered with the listener because the instance is in nomount, and no other services are available yet.

    ```
    <copy>
    rman \
    target sys/WElcome123##@adghol0_dgci \
    auxiliary=sys/WElcome123##@adghol1_sci
    </copy>
    ```

    If you have any issues with the connection, verify that the connection strings can be resolved. We created them in the previous lab.

    ![RMAN connection to target and auxiliary](images/rman-connect.png)

3. Run the duplicate command. The `FOR STANDBY` clause restores a copy of the control file for the standby role.

    ```
    <copy>
    run {
    allocate channel c1 device type disk;
    allocate auxiliary channel a1 device type disk;
    allocate auxiliary channel a2 device type disk;
    DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE  FOR STANDBY FROM ACTIVE DATABASE USING BACKUPSET NOFILENAMECHECK;
    }
    </copy>
    ```
    ![RMAN duplicate succeeded](images/duplicate.png)

    Then exit the RMAN command line:
    ```
    <copy>exit</copy>
    ```

    For more information about the DUPLICATE command, [refer to the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/rcmrf/DUPLICATE.html).

## Task 4: Finish the standby database configuration

1. Connect to the freshly duplicated standby database and clear the online and standby redo logs:

    ```
    <copy>sql / as sysdba </copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>
    select * from v$log;
    alter database clear logfile group 1, group 2, group 3;
    select * from v$standby_log;
    alter database clear logfile group 4, group 5, group 6;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Clear online and standby logs](images/clear-standby-logs.png)

    The standby redo logs (sometimes shortened as SRLs) are fundamental for receiving the current redo stream from the primary database.

2. Set some recommended parameters:

    ```
    <copy>
    alter system set dg_broker_start=true scope=spfile;
    alter system set db_files=1024 scope=spfile;
    alter system set log_buffer=256M scope=spfile;
    alter system set db_lost_write_protect=typical scope=spfile;
    alter system set db_block_checksum=typical scope=spfile;
    alter system set db_flashback_retention_target=120 scope=spfile;
    alter system set parallel_threads_per_cpu=1 scope=spfile;
    alter system set standby_file_management=auto scope=spfile;
    </copy>
    ```

3. Restart the instance to take the new parameters:

    ```
    <copy>
    startup force mount
    exit
    </copy>
    ```
    ![End of the standby configuration](images/standby-configuration.png)

You have successfully duplicated and configured the standby database for Data Guard. In the next lab, we will create and verify the Data Guard configuration.
